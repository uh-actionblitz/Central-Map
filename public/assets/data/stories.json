As bad as that sounds, my former employer’s deductible was even worse: $4000 on my own.  Last summer I had huge emergency expenses, and I found out that I have to pay co-insurance on top of the deductible.  I’m on several payment plans, and altogether I owe about $5000, which I’m struggling to pay off.  This is so wrong!  Insurance companies should not be able to do this",
